# No Design Guidelines Needed

This project is a **backend API service** for Discord bot license verification with no user interface components.

## Project Type: Backend API Only

The system consists of:
- REST API endpoint for license verification
- MongoDB database connection
- JSON request/response handling
- Server-side authentication and validation

## No Visual Interface Required

Since this is purely an API service with no frontend, dashboard, or user-facing components, there are no design guidelines to provide. The project requires:

- **Technical implementation only:** API routes, database queries, authentication
- **No UI elements:** No buttons, forms, layouts, or visual components
- **No user-facing pages:** The "users" are Discord bots making programmatic API calls

## If You Need a Dashboard Later

If you decide to add an admin dashboard in the future for managing licenses, you would need:
- Login page for admin access
- License management interface (create/view/delete licenses)
- Analytics dashboard showing active licenses
- User/purchase tracking

At that point, design guidelines would be relevant for those admin interface components.

**Current Status:** Proceed with backend implementation only - no design work required at this stage.
